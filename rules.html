            <img src="rules.webp" width="400px" height="370px">
            <p>Here is a breakdown of badminton rules based on “Laws of Badminton Regulations 2017” by the Badminton World Federation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coins">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">The coin toss – who goes first?</h2>
            <p>Before a tournament starts, a coin is tossed. The winner of the coin toss will then get to choose either
                <ul>
                    <li>to serve or to receive first or</li>
                    <li>the preferred side of the court</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The loser of the coin toss will then exercise the remaining choice.
                However, if it is just a friendly game with your family or friends, you may wish to use rock-paper-scissors to determine the winner of who’s going to go first.</p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Badminton Service</h2>
            <p>A serve is delivered diagonally across the courts. During service, both the server and receiver must stand at diagonally opposite sides without touching the boundary 
                lines of the badminton courts. During a serve, the point at which the racquet is allowed to come into contact with the shuttlecock must happen below the server’s waist. 
                Once the players are ready, the first forward movement of the server’s racket shall be the start of the service. The server shall not serve before the receiver is ready. 
                However, the receiver will be considered to have been ready if a return of service is attempted.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Rally</h2>
            <p>A rally starts with a serve, often continuing with a series of shots exchanged between opposing sides before it finally ends when a point is scored.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="scoring">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Badminton Scoring System – 3 (games) x 21 (points)</h2>
            <pre style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
            The 3 (game sets) x 21 (points) scoring system was first introduced in December 2005 and is now the official scoring system 
            used at professional tournaments.

            Despite the official updates to the rules, some recreational players (particularly those who have been playing badminton for 
            many years) still follow the traditional scoring system where winners are determined by the best of three games, played to 15 
            points for men and 11 points for women.

            In the official tournament rules today, a badminton match consists of three games. The winner of the best of three shall be 
            crowned the winner.

            The first player/team to score 21 points wins a game.

            A point is awarded to the player/team that wins the rally.

            In the event that a game reaches a 20-20 score, players can only win the set by getting a 2 point lead over the opposing party, 
            e.g. 22-20, 23-21, 24-22 etc.

            In the event that the game reaches a 29-29 score, the first team to reach 30 points will win the set and take the service for 
            the next game.</pre>
            </div>
        <div class="singles_and_doubles">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Scoring in Badminton Singles</h2>
            <p>If the server wins a rally, the server shall score a point and shall serve again from the alternate service court. If the receiver wins a rally, the receiver 
                shall score a point. The receiver will become the new server.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">The sequence of serving in a doubles game shall follow</h2>
            <p>From the initial server who started the game from the right service court to the partner of the initial receiver, to the partner of the initial server, to the 
                initial receiver and back to the initial server and so on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sides">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Switching sides on the court</h2>
            <p>Here are a few instances where players or teams will switch sides on the court,
                <ul>
                    <li>At the end of the first game</li>
                    <li>At the end of the second game if there is a third game</li>
                    <li>During the third game, the first player/team scores 11 points.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="details">
            <h2 style="font-size: 50px">Details</h2>
            <p>For a detailed breakdown of badminton rules, do refer to the Badminton World Federation “The LAWS of Badminton”. Badminton Court Rules in a nutshell Like many other 
                sports, winner of the coin toss shall have a say in who serves first and gets to choose the side of the court they prefer. Badminton is played in a best of three set 
                formats. The first to reach 21 points will win the set. Service is always delivered diagonally across the court be it in Singles or Doubles play. Switch sides of the 
                court after every game and after the first player to score 11 points on the 3rd game if it exists.</p>
